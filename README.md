## Reference
Some parts of this repository are based on Chapter 2 in this very well-written book about machine learning: [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (2nd ed.)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by Aurélien Géron. I would give this book 4.9 out of 5 and highly recommend it to anyone who wish to learn about machine learning and deep learning.
